## Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunications Industry

Developed supervised learning algorithms for telecommunications service vendors to predict customer churn probability

1.Preprocessed data set by data cleaning and classifying, correlation analysis, standardization, visualization, etc.

2.Trained supervised machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors, and
applied regularization with optimal parameters to overcome overfitting

3.Evaluated model performance of classification via k-fold cross-validation technique and analyzed feature importance to
identify top factors that influenced the results
